# Make electron apps with `js-wasm`

Making apps with WebAssembly is as simple as making website! `electron` is a technology that packages chrome into an easy single page web experience. It gives the user access to the local systems resources via a JavaScript api. Since `js-wasm` is a technology agnostic library for executing javascript from WebAssembly, we can easily bind to the parts of the `electron` API we need.
